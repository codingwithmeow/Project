In this project, a small weather station was created using PicoBricks.

Raspberry Pi Pico W can be coded easily without wiring, thanks to its PicoBricks base.

The data received from the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor was sent to the Thingspeak environment. A database can be created with this data. It is also shown on the OLED screen.

RGB LED turn red at temperatures above 25 Celsius, yellow lights at temperatures between 25 Celsius and 10 Celsius, and blue lights below 10 Celsius.

In addition, at temperatures below 4 Celsius, the warning "There is a danger of icing" is written on the OLED screen and the buzzer beeps.
